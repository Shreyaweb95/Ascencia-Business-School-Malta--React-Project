          <h4>Openness to International Markets</h4>
          <p>
            This is our purpose. Our programs have been specifically designed to
            host international students and enable French students to do their
            internship in the English language or part of their training in
            another country, at the heart of the international system: an
            excellent French language school, a network of representative
            offices and university partners.

          <h4>Teaching Excellence</h4>
          <p>
            The member schools of Ascencia are all recognised in their
            specialised domains and prepare graduates to achieve insertion in
            world job markets. The faculty comprises an academic lecturing body
            and the best professional players. All the programs lead to a
            state-recognised certification.

          <h4>Job Access</h4>
          <p>
            Because each training course corresponds to a personal ambition, all
            our students receive individual attention. The success of each
            student is our priority. Our teams accompany each student in the
            success of his project. Professional integration, promoted by
            work-linked training, is our top priority.
