        </h2>

        <p>
          Ascencia Malta is located in Floriana – right on the doorstep of Valletta.
          Floriana was meant to be a suburb of Valletta, but it developed to be a
          town on its own. A short walk separates the two towns. It isn't easy to
          understand where Floriana finishes and Valletta starts, but the iconic
          entry to the capital is part of Floriana. Floriana sits in the very heart
          of the Maltese islands, with roads leading to all the bustling and major
          cities in Malta.
